- Keanu Reeves is the GOAT
- 10/10. Generational movie.  Written and directed by the Wachowskis. Highly recommended.
- The film follows Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer who leads a double life as a hacker known as Neo. He feels something is amiss in his life and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines that control humanity. Neo is contacted by Trinity, a skilled hacker, and Morpheus, a leader of the resistance, who believes Neo is "the One" prophesied to end the war between humans and machines. Morpheus offers Neo a choice between a red pill, which will reveal the truth about the Matrix, and a blue pill, which will allow him to return to his normal life. Neo chooses the red pill and awakens in the real world, where he learns that humanity is enslaved by machines that use their bodies as energy sources while keeping their minds trapped in a simulated reality known as the Matrix.
